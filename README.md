# Solar-Charge-Regulator
The goal of this project is to create a solar charge controller that uses an Arduino UNO, voltage
dividers, and a 16 x 2 LCD display to securely charge a lead acid car battery in a remote location where
there is no access to 220V AC energy. The solar charge controller prevents overcharging and fast
charging, which can harm the battery and endanger one's safety. It manages the solar panel current
by using voltage dividers to scale down the battery voltage range into the Arduino's input range. The
LCD display gives information about the charging process. By employing this solar charge controller, a
person can charge their car battery using solar electricity while also assuring safe and efficient
functioning.
