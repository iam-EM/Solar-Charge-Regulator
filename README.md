# Solar-Charge-Regulator

## Abstract
This project, completed as part of the Embedded Systems subject in my bachelor's degree in computer engineering, aims to create a prototype solar charge controller using an Arduino UNO, voltage dividers, a 16x2 LCD display, a DC power supply to regulate voltage, and capacitors to store energy. The prototype securely charges a lead-acid car battery, simulating conditions where there is no access to 220V AC energy. The controller prevents overcharging and fast charging, ensuring battery safety and longevity while providing real-time charging information on the LCD display.

## Introduction to the Problem
In remote locations without access to 220V AC power, charging a car battery can be challenging. Overcharging and fast charging can harm the battery and pose safety risks, necessitating a reliable and efficient charging solution.

## Why You Want to Fix It
Ensuring the safe and efficient charging of car batteries in remote areas is essential. Overcharging and fast charging can significantly reduce battery life and potentially cause dangerous situations. A charge controller can mitigate these risks by managing the charging process.

## How Youâ€™re Going to Fix It
This project involves designing a charge controller that uses an Arduino UNO to monitor and regulate the charging process. Voltage dividers scale down the battery voltage to fit within the Arduino's input range, and a 16x2 LCD display provides real-time information about the charging status. Instead of a solar panel, a DC power supply is used to regulate voltage, and capacitors are used to store energy.

   void setup() {
     lcd.begin(16, 2);
     lcd.print("Charge Controller");
   }

   void loop() {
     int sensorValue = analogRead(analogPin);
     float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);
     lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
     lcd.print("Voltage: ");
     lcd.print(voltage);
     delay(1000);
   }
